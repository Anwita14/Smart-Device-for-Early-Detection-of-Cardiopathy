# Smart Device for Early Detection of Cardiopathy and Induced Stress Condition

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart device designed to detect early signs of cardiopathy and stress conditions.  
It uses **MAX30100**, **ECG sensor**, and **temperature sensor** to monitor vital health parameters in real time.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Heart rate, SpOâ‚‚, ECG, and body temperature monitoring.
- Real-time data visualization via **Streamlit** web application.
- Cardiopathy prediction using integrated ML model.
- Immediate alerts for abnormal health readings.

## ðŸ–¥ Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** MAX30100, ECG sensor, Temperature sensor
- **Software:** Python, Streamlit, Arduino IDE
- **Communication:** via video or photo of the readings
